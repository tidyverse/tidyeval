This guide is now superseded by more recent efforts at documenting tidy evaluation in a user-friendly way. We now recommend reading:

- The new [Programming with dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) vignette.

- The [Using ggplot2 in packages](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html) vignette.

We are keeping this bookdown guide online for posterity, but please know that it is missing a lot of advances that make tidy eval more palatable, such as the embracing operator `{{ arg }}` and [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) support for custom names.
